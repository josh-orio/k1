HARDWARE:
- implement device trees using existing device tree formats (.dts, .dtsi, .dtb)
- figure out how to get the right dtb onto corresponding hardware (cat to kernel image, bootloader (uboot))

SOFTWARE:
- process a dtb on startup, only "non-discoverable" hardware: cores, memory ... something else?
- set up a task queue and some scheduler which sorts it.
- get other cores out of spin lock by directing them to pick a task off the queue
- start some user space processes, disk drivers, filesystems
